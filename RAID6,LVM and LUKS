Raid6 + LVM + Luks

For this Configurations there are some possible ways of doing it for example:
-> RAID --> LUKS --> LVM --> ext4(or xfs) (in case you want to use only 1 password)(line 7-69)
-> RAID --> LVM --> LUKS --> ext4(or xfs) (in case you need to combine some Raids with LVM)(line 73-116)

RAID --> LUKS --> LVM --> ext469
in AWS
- its needed a machine (ubuntu or Redhat)
- 4+ Volumes (since its Raid 6 its required atleast 4 disks/volumes)
- attach all the volumes to the machine (EC2->Volumes->Create Volume(in the same zone as the machine!)-> Actions-> Attach Volume)

In Terminal (Termius or Putty)

-> Create a partition for each one of the volumes
-> gdisk /dev/xvdf (do this for all the disks)
   -> o (new empty GUID partition table (GPT)(to clean all the partitions done/to confirm its clean)-> n (new partition)-> fd00 this option is done on after chossing the side of the partition
-> w to save the changes -> Y (to confirm all the options)

RAID 6
-> mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level 6 --raid-devices 4 /dev/xvdf1 /dev/xvdg1 /dev/xvdh1 /dev/xvdi1 (here you need to put all the partitions you want to use on the Raid, and since its an RAID6 you need atleast 4)(md0 is a name that you choose)
-> mdadm --detail /dev/md0
   ->(after you do the command above wait for,do the command again until it shows that)
	State : clean
	Active Devices : 4
	Working Devices : 4
	Failed Devices : 0
	Spare Devices : 0

LUCKS

this configurations is made so you can encrypt the volume

-> cryptsetup luksFormat --hash=sha512 --key-size=512 --cipher=aes-xts-plain64 --verify-passphrase /dev/md0 (here you encrypting the md0(the keysize it can different there is other type of key sizes)
  -> YES and write the Password you want, be carefull this will override data on /dev/md0 
-> cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md0 md0_crypt (md0_crypt this can be any name you want)

LVM

-> pvcreate /dev/mapper/md0_crypt (here its created the phsical volume)
-> vgcreate vg0 /dev/mapper/md0_crypt ( here its made the volume group)
-> lvcreate -n lv0 -l +100%FREE vg0   ( and here the logical volume)

-> mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/md0_crypt (you only can do this if cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md0 md0_crypt worked) <------ mkfs.xfs /dev/vg0/lv0
After the Raid + Lucks + Lvm are done do:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -> [WARNING: if in the next 2 lines is > insted of >> you will need to start all again so be carefull]
blkid | grep cryp >> /etc/crypttab [you should have 1 line with TYPE="crypto_LUKS" and the other with TYPE="ext4"]
blkid | grep cryp >> /etc/fstab [you should have 1 line with TYPE="crypto_LUKS" and the other with TYPE="ext4"]

-> nano /etc/crypttab
   -> md0_crypt UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx none luks [The UUID is on the line with TYPE="crypto_LUKS" ,comment this 2 lines (/dev/md0 e /dev/mapper/md0_crypt)]

-> nano /etc/fstab
   -> UUID=yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy /mnt/raid6 ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0 [the UUID is on the line with TYPE="ext4" , comment this 2 lines (/dev/md0 e /dev/mapper/md0_crypt)]
-> mount -a
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
->  mkdir /mnt/______________
-> mount /dev/vg0/lv0 /mnt/___________
-> cat /etc/mtab -> in this step you need to copy the line associated with the mount command
-> nano /fstab -> and paste it inside
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> in the end reboot ,it should ask the password to mount the disk

-> commands you should use to check:
	-> df -h -> check if it says /mnt/raid6( it should show /mnt/raid6 is mounted in /dev/mapper/md0_crypt and that it has 1/2 of the size of the 4 disks)
	-> mdadm --detail /dev/md0 ( it shows that is raid6 and which are the volumes that form the raid and it should say "State: Clean"
	-> cryptsetup luksDump /dev/md/md0 (it shows details of the encryption)
	-> lsblk to show the partitions and the disks
	
	
	
RAID --> LVM --> LUKS --> xfs

gdisk /dev/xvdj creating a partition on disk xvdj
gdisk /dev/xvdk creating a partition on disk xvdk
gdisk /dev/xvdl creating a partition on disk xvdl
gdisk /dev/xvdm creating a partition on disk xvdm
-> o (new empty GUID partition table (GPT)(to clean all the partitions done/to confirm its clean)-> n (new partition)-> fd00 this option is done on after chossing the side of the partition

 RAID 6   
mdadm --create /dev/md1 --level 6 --raid-devices 4 /dev/xvdj1 /dev/xvdk1 /dev/xvdl1 /dev/xvdm1 (here you need to put all the partitions you want to use on the Raid, and since its an RAID6 you need atleast 4)(md1 is a name that you choose)
mdadm --detail /dev/md1
 ->(after you do the command above wait for,do the command again until it shows that)
	State : clean
	Active Devices : 4
	Working Devices : 4
	Failed Devices : 0
	Spare Devices : 0

LVM 

pvcreate /dev/md1 (here its created the phsical volume)
vgcreate vg1 /dev/md1 (here its made the volume group)
lvcreate -n lv0 -l +100%FREE vg1 (and here the logical volume)

LUKS

cryptsetup luksFormat --hash=sha512 --key-size=512 --cipher=aes-xts-plain64 --verify-passphrase /dev/vg1/lv0
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/vg1/lv0 lv0_crypt

mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/lv0_crypt

mkdir /mnt/________
mount /dev/mapper/lv0_crypt /mnt/_______

-> cat /etc/mtab -> in this step you need to copy the line associated with the mount command
-> nano /fstab -> and paste it inside

-> in the end reboot ,it should ask the password to mount the disk

-> commands you should use to check:
	-> df -h -> check if it says /mnt/raid6( it should show /mnt/raid6 is mounted in /dev/mapper/md0_crypt and that it has 1/2 of the size of the 4 disks)
